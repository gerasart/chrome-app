                Safe Storage Tips
                â€¢ Save your backup in multiple locations.
                â€¢ Never share this phrase with anyone.
                â€¢ Beware of phishing! MetaMask will never unexpectedly ask you for your recovery passphrase.
                â€¢ If you need to back up your passphrase again for recovery, you can find this feature under "Settings"
                -> "Security".
                â€¢ If you have any questions or see anything suspicious, please contact our support team here.
                *Just remember that MetaMask cannot recover the recovery passphrase. Find out more.
